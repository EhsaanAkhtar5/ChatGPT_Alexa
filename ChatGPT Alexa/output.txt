I hope this works
yeah okay
ok I hope this works 12
ok this should work in real time now
yeah it just takes a second
okay that's not too bad
hello 1 2 3
ok so while it's just recording and it's got unknown error occurred
to avoid that
okay it can print unknown error code but I can't write that
catchy PC
cat GPT
hey Momo
hello 1 2 3
I didn't change if it should be printing

ok I've chosen to put it there now
that should stop it why isn't it stopping it
hello hello
hello 1 2 3
ok this was working so much better before
there you go so it does work it's just it doesn't like the fun noise
hello
ok let's see does it transcribe as long as I talk
so it works pretty well to start with but then it stops working
why does it not work when subtle speaks
yeah I guess it can't catch laughing
so why doesn't it work when we pass it around it just kind of stops working
ok I've taken out all the crazy quote I added in
crazy cold I said
I mean like I can't be pretty cool but I don't know how this is going to work
so we will know that how long does this actually last
how does it get worse as it goes on
wow this is kind of shy
hello hello
does it recognise like words that aren't in the dictionary
MOMO is the best
ok well certain words don't work do that
actually
ok hey Mama
and then it would start recording and then I'd be like what is write me an essay on Pirates
PC
hello hello

raspberry pyara
not Piper can we sort this out please it's not very good voice recognition program
Raspberry Pi error
